1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS,
JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
○ A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior
to visualization (must be approved)

3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.

5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus,
dropdowns, textboxes).

6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
